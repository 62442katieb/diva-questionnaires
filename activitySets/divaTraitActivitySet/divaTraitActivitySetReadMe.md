participate in a variety of activities, including fMRI scans, online 
questionnaires, and biological specimen collection. Here, we will be
asking you to complete a series of questionnaires to help us 
understand you a little better before we begin the study.</p>

<h3 align="center">Have you completed a consent form?</h3>

questionnaires. Do **not** proceed unless you have completed a
consent form for the DIVA Study. When you have finished, remember
