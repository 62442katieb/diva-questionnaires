# Welcome to the DIVA Project
The Dense Investigation of Variability of Affect, or DIVA, Study is a 13-week study intended to help us gain a better understanding of how brain activity and emotion vary within individuals. We are asking you to participate
because you are an adult female between the ages of 18 and 30 years
old. The DIVA Study include MRI sessions, 

## Affect
This part of the DIVA Study includes questionnaires you can answer on your phone or on a computer that help us understand different aspects of your mood and how they change over time. You will be asked to fill out these questionnaires twice a week, prompted by notifications on your phone.

## Lifestyle
One of the goals of the DIVA Study is to better understand how mood is related to the way we live our lives. Are you more cranky when you haven't slept well? Does exercise boost your mood and/or alleivate stress? By answering questions about your recent sleep exercise habits, we can look for relationships between your habits and mood fluctuations.

## Your Data
Finally, all your data will be accessible to you throughout the course of the study, so that you can track your mood and habits, as well!
